# Bikeshop SQL Project

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing data from the Bikeshop database. The project focuses on deriving meaningful insights from the order and product data, enabling effective decision-making for sales and inventory management.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

### SQL Proficiency
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilized SQL for data extraction and manipulation, ensuring accurate analysis of sales and order data.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Employed aggregate functions like `SUM()` and `COUNT()` to calculate total revenues, order counts, and other key metrics.

### SQL Techniques
- **Window Functions**: Implemented `RANK()` to analyze product rankings based on list prices, allowing for insights into high-value products.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Used CTEs to simplify complex queries, particularly when filtering and aggregating high-priced products.

### Data Analysis
- **Revenue Analysis**: Analyzed both gross and net revenues over various time periods (daily and monthly) to assess sales performance.
- **Customer Insights**: Counted orders by customer and grouped results by geographic regions, providing valuable insights into customer behavior.

### Data Aggregation and Grouping
- **Group By Operations**: Leveraged `GROUP BY` to summarize data effectively, enabling analysis at different granularities (e.g., by month, day, customer, and store).
- **Joining Tables**: Proficiently joined multiple tables (e.g., orders, order_items, customers, products) to create comprehensive datasets for analysis.

### Reporting and Visualization
- **Visualization Concepts**: While not implemented in SQL, there is an understanding of how to present data insights effectively using tools like Power BI.
