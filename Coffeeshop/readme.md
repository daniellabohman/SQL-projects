# Coffee Shop Sales SQL Project

## Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a coffee shop to extract meaningful insights about transactions, revenue generation, product pricing, and customer behavior. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the coffee shop's sales performance and assist in making data-driven business decisions.

## Key Objectives
- **Analyze Sales Performance**: Determine the overall sales performance by calculating total revenue and transaction counts.
- **Product Insights**: Rank products based on pricing and categorize them into high and low price segments.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Assess customer purchasing patterns and store performance through transaction data.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Examine sales trends over time to identify peak sales periods and potential seasonal variations.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Proficiency**: Strong ability to write complex SQL queries for data analysis and reporting.
- **Data Aggregation**: Skilled in using aggregate functions (e.g., `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`) to compute metrics and derive insights.
- **Window Functions**: Experience in using window functions (e.g., `DENSE_RANK()`) to rank and analyze data effectively.
- **Grouping and Partitioning**: Proficient in grouping data by various dimensions (e.g., product, store, date) to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Utilized CTEs to simplify complex queries and improve overall readability.
- **Data Visualization**: Understanding of how to visualize data insights, potentially using tools like Power BI to enhance presentation and interpretation of results.
